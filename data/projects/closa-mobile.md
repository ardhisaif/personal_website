Our goal of the Closa App is to make it easier for our members to:

- Plan their day without hassle.
- Help them do one task that matters of the day, we called it “Highlight”.
- and automatically post the log of their activities to our discord channel to keep them accountable.

So here is our first look at Closa App with features that will help us accomplish those goals.

## Simple To-do

Discord seems a little bit hassle to help you update your daily highlight & task. Closa App helps you planning the day without hassle.

## Reminder

No need to back-and-forth checking your tasks. Our reminder feature will help you stay updated on your next task.

## History

We want to remember moments, not days. We provide a dedicated place to look back on your completed task and highlight.

## Surprising Image

Complete all of your tasks on that day, and Closa will show you a handpicked staggering image right from the app. We want to give a sense of calm after you've done what matters on that day.

## Discord Integration

When you ticked your task, your updates will immediately be posted on discord. So, you don't need to type twice about your task only to update your progress.

# Backlog: A Space for Future Work that Matters

Backlog helps you save your future task or the task that you sometimes forgot to tick. You can access the backlog from the menu icon on the left bottom of the screen. There are 2 sections on the backlog page when you are looking at the task:

## Pending task

This top section is where your task going when you forgot to tick your task from the previous day. So, you don't need to remember what you are up to.

## Task with date

This section below the pending task is where your upcoming task going. Your future task grouped based on the date you set when the task added to your backlog.
